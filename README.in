# pidgin-logviewer

This project aims to present an alternative, user-friendly and intuitive way of viewing chat logs in Pidgin.
Currently the project is in an early stage, and is designed as a plugin, but it eventually aims to replace pidgin's default log viewer.

This repository is a fork from the https://code.google.com/p/pidgin-logviewer/ as it seems to be aboded by the original authors.
As this plugin is already quite helpful, I will take over maintenance.

pidgin-logviewer is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.
For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.
