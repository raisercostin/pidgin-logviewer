This project aims to present an alternative, user-friendly and intuitive way of viewing chat logs in Pidgin. Currently the project is in an early stage, and is designed as a plugin, but it eventually aims to replace pidgin's default log viewer. 

pidgin-logviewer is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.
For documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory.
For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.
